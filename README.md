## Python_assignment2

1. Create a plot that shows performance (AUC) of random forest models (x axis) with 10, 20, 30, … 200 (y axis) on training and testing data (build all 20 models to complete the assignment). Use highUtilizationPredictionV2wco dataset.
2. Rank input attributes in the data. Create a plot that shows dependency between number of selected top attributes (x axis) and AUC of learned model (y axis). You can use any attribute selection method and any classifier you want. Use highUtilizationPredictionV2wco dataset. 
3. Create a learning curve for the data to check AUC (y axis) based on size of data (x axis).
4. Create 5 more learning curves (on one plot) for different numbers of input attributes. Do it for random forest, logistic regression, and naïve Bayes.
* Use random selection of input attributes
* Use ranking of attributes from question 2
